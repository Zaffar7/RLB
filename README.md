# RLB
Objective: Develop a predictive model for the remaining battery life of the batteries based on several features such as discharge time, voltage, charging time, etc.
Cycle Index: number of cycle
F1: Discharge Time (s)
F2: Time at 4.15V (s)
F3: Time Constant Current (s)
F4: Decrement 3.6-3.4V (s)
F5: Max. Voltage Discharge (V)
F6: Min. Voltage Charge (V)
F7: Charging Time (s)
Total time (s)

Methods:
Data cleansing, visualization (e.g., pair plots, joint plots), and exploration.
Application of multiple regression methods including Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, PyTorch, and TensorFlow models.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Regression comparison
